## Uphack

Uphack is a front-end client that interacts with [Mint](https://github.com/Hashnode/mint) blockchain. If you wish to roll out your own front-end and interact with the underlying blockchain check out [Mint](https://github.com/Hashnode/mint).

## Details

We are experimenting with a content storage blockchain called Mint. It was created out of a need for JSON storage on blockchain. Uphack is the first client that interacts with Mint. 

> Uphack is Hackernews on Blockchain.

We created this demo to show how to build blockchain powered social apps easily. This is super early and experimental. The primary reason behind open sourcing the code is to get early feedback and improve the codebase.

## Code Contribution

Feel free to send PRs to both Uphack and Mint. We are thrilled to see your contributions. :)
