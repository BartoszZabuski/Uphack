## Uphack

Uphack is a front-end client that interacts with [Mint](https://github.com/Hashnode/mint) blockchain. If you wish to roll out your own front-end and interact with the underlying blockchain check out [Mint](https://github.com/Hashnode/mint).

## TLDR

We are experimenting with a content-storage blockchain called Mint. It was created out of a need for JSON storage on blockchain. Uphack is the first client that interacts with Mint. 

> Uphack is Hackernews on Blockchain.

We created this demo to show how to build blockchain powered social apps easily. This is super early and experimental. The primary reason behind open sourcing the repo is to get early feedback and improve the codebase.

## How to run

```
git clone https://github.com/Hashnode/Uphack
cd Uphack
yarn
gulp less // make sure gulp is installed globally
node server.js
```
